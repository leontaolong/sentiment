# Twitter Sentiment Analysis
This is a web page written in _JavaScript_ to perform simple sentiment analysis of Twitter dataâ€”-that is, determining the "attitude" of tweets (how "positive", "negative", "joyful", etc) made by a particular twitter user and calculating the percentage of each sentiment across all tweets. It performs this analysis on real data taken directly from a Twitter user's timeline through [Twitter API](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public)
